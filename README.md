# laravel-svelte-TS 

Basic Svelte + Inertiajs + Laravel template

With srr

`npm run dev`  
Will run:  
`php artisan serve`  
and:  
`vite`  
 
So you only need to run 1 command

I might want to add more packages to this to make it integrate a bit better,  
this might include something like:
- ziggy-js

But I do not want to add any specific packages like:
- Bootstrap / tailwind etc..

I want to leave those options to the developer
